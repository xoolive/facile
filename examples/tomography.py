"""
This is a little 'tomography' problem, taken from an old issue
of Scientific American.
A matrix which contains zeroes and ones gets "x-rayed" vertically and
horizontally, giving the total number of ones in each row and column.
The problem is to reconstruct the contents of the matrix from this
information.
