# A Golf Tournament (from http://www.icparc.ic.ac.uk/~cg6/conjunto.html)
#
# There are 32 golfers, who play individually but in groups of 4, called
# foursomes. The tournament is organized in weeks. Each week a new set of
# foursomes has to be computed such that each person only golfs with the same
# person once. So if two golfers have played each other in any previous week
# they should not play each other in the coming weeks.
#
# The question is: "How many weeks can we ensure this before players start to
# play each other a second time ?"
#
# The formulation is generalized to any number of golfers, groups and weeks.
